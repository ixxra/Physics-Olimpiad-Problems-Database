This is a database of physics problems coming from the international physics olympiad... here you can find the tools needed to process such problems.


INTRODUCTION


As this project main objective is to build a database of problems, each one writen with latex, here there should be a directory structure like this one:

year
 |
 + Problem1
 |  |
 |  - Problem1.tex
 |  - figure1.jpg
 |  - figure2.png
 |
 |
 + Problem2

As every problem was typed on a windows machine by a student knowing nothing about computers, latex, and so on, here you can find 
tools to merge the problems in a computer friendly fashion.


BASIC USAGE


1. Copy every .tex file into a .tex.old file
2. use problem_to_utf8.sh to transcode these problems into utf8 if needed
3. use convert_figures.sh to modify .tex into .tex.out with figures renamed to an unambiguous filename
4. use cut_problem.sh to extract the problems from each .tex.out file

feel free to open the .sh and .py files to get more information
